Video games have been booming during the pandemic period in 2020. We are studying the evolution of video game trends around this period. We looked at some datasets that can  allow us to correlate the genre and platform with the number of sales. The aim of this project will be to know the bestseller genre and platform that will be sold during 2021. For that, we will use as inputs (platform, genre and Total_Shipped) contained inside the chosen datasets. Finally, we will try to predict two outputs, the most popular genre and platform during 2021 (platform, genre).
